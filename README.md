# Citibike2
Do you use Citibike but find the mobile app terrible? Are you trying to awkwardly plan a bike route using google maps and then wondering where you can find or park your Citibike for the route? Do you find yourself wondering if theres a bike at your starting station, whether or not youâ€™ll be able to park it once you get to your destination, and how long the whole ordeal will take? Me too, so I decided to do something about it.

An app development and learning experiment in Angular 2, Node, and Express with GoogleMaps and Citibike apis.
